    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls
    a visitor function for every node found. This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are `visit_` + class
    name of the node. So a `BinOp` node visit function would be
    `visit_BinOp`. This behavior can be changed by overriding the `visit`
    method. If no visitor function exists for a node the `_generic_visit`
    visitor is used instead.
